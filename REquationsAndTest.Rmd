## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

# how to write mathematical formulas in Rmarkdown 

inline equaiton, $x^2+/sqrt{x+1} = 0$
the theoretical formula for linear regression is given by,  
$$
y= \alpha_0 + \alpha_1 x_1 + \cdots+\alpha_k x_k + \epsilon.
$$
Data Structure
$y= \{ y_1, y_2, \cdots, y_n \}$

$x_1 = \{x_{1,1}, x_{1,2} \}$

$x^2{(0)}_{2,3}      $

#sum and product
$$
L(\mu, \sigma)=\prod_{i=1}^n \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-\frac{(x_i-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}
$$
The log likelihood is given by
$$
l(\mu,\sigma)= \sum_{i=1}^n \log \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-\frac{(x_i-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}\right)
$$
